# Golden_Jackal
The Golden Jackal is a single-player boss fight in which the player fights a reincarnated version of the Egyptian god, Anubis. With a team of seven people, this was my first experience working with a larger number people. With the increase of size in the game team, I learned the importance of source control and the difficulties that can bring. In an effort to ease the difficulty of this source control, a shared drive was made to allocate assets, and the other programmer and I were put in charge of using and allocating said assets into one joined version that we would develop together in order to avoid confused versions with seperate data. It was also a great means of honing my ability with UI, animations, and an introduction to state machines.
